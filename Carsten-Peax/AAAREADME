This work is available at bitbucket.org/hfclinicaldata/peax-pmp, as well as on github. 

Each of these directories has a data directory and each contained the following files:
	combined-5.csv
	combined.csv
	pilot_4.csv
	short.csv
	shortColumn.csv
	medium.csv

Since they are data with more restrictive distribution policies they are in the Harmonization_Data project under similar paths.
