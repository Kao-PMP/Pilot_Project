02_clustering and 05_random_forest are unuseable programs. 
Could not install required packages for both analyses, mainly due to R version and package requirement being different.

Final programs:
00_build_db
01_baseline
03_kmeans
03b_km_table
04_Cox_BP
06_mlp
07_bp_risk

Most ipynb files will be downloaded as .html files
Most ipynb files were converted to R files as well, though some R files were edited after downloading
Use "jupyter nbconvert --to python <file>" to convert a notebook to a code file. R should be used in place of python but doesn't work. Remove the first line from the python file and rename it to make this way work.
